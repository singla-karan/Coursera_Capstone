# IBM Capstone Project

## Project 1\
File : Applied Data Science Capstone 1
Description: 
In this project, I am required to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information.

For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information I need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. I will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset.

Once the data is in a structured format, you can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

Table of Content\
1. Scrap content from wiki page.
2. Get the latitude and the longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.
3. Explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto
